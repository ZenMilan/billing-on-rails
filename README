== Welcome to Billing on Rails

Billing on Rails is a simple Billing Application written in Ruby on Rails and licensed under GPLv3 (see LICENSE file for details).

Migration 012 creates a company for you now, you can edit this by clicking "Edit Company" in the app.

Start by editing the config/database_example.yml to your needs and saving it as config/database.yml. Then run rake db:create and rake db:migrate. Now you should be all set up.
You can put your company's logo into public/images/logo.gif and edit the .css files to your liking, in order to make them fit to your exisiting bill design.

I hope you like this software. If you have any questions, ug reports or suggestions please contact me at github.com (My Nickname is: flyfloh) or at my Blog: http://blog.fly-soft.de.
